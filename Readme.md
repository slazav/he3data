Digitized data from old papers. Mostly superfluid 3He.
Many thanks to https://github.com/pn2200/g3data project.

Previously I was keeping these data in `he3lib/data`, in 2025
I moved them to a separate repo.

Paper naming follow my personal library (put I'm going to put correct
references).

Ideas and corrections are welcome!
